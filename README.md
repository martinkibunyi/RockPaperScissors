# Project3_RockPaperScissors

This is rock paper scissors, You know how it works!!!

Fancy a try, copy paste the code from main.py into your fav IDE, run and play away, against the PC ofcourse.
Two player mode coming soon.

Two player mode uploaded now, check in main file repo for the code.
Note, no need for importing random module since the computer nor us are guessing anything.
